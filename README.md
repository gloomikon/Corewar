This project involves creating a virtual arena, and having simplistic-language programs fight each other.  
You will thus get acquainted with VM conception (with instructions it recognizes, registers, etc) and compilation   
problems of an assembly language in bytecode. In bonus, the pleasure to have your champions fight in the arena.  
  
 You can also use `test.sh` to test correctness of `asm`. You need to have your `asm`, `test.sh` and `resources/`  
 in root folder and start like this:  
 `./test.sh asm all`  
   
  It will compile all champions, display your and standart message and difference of output if file of  
  the champion was corrct.
